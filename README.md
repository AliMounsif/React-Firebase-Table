## What I used

* ReactJS, to develop the technical test, I've also used Redux as a reducer
  - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
* Firebase, to store my datatable (with public db and storage to everyone, no rules)
* Materialize, for some auxiliar css for the form (fields, buttons, icons)
* Ant Design for table component, filtering, sorting, pagination

## Re-use sortable table

The sortable table it's a component, and it will not affect the code structure if re used, 
to re use it we could also create a react Component with the table component of Ant and pass to this component our data and columns,
 or other possible options; in this way every time we need to create a table we have already our component that could have a unique design or styles in all the app. 

## Usage

* install yarn in your pc
* get in the project directory 
* run:
  yarn install 
  yarn start

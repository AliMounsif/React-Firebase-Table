## React + Redux, with Firebase data-table db/storage

## What I used

* ReactJS, to develop the technical test, I've also used Redux as a reducer
  - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
* Firebase, to store my datatable
* Materialize, for some auxiliar css for the form (fields, buttons, icons)
* Ant Design for table component, filtering, sorting, pagination

## Usage

* create your firebase free app
* insert your firebase app configuration in config/dev.js
* install yarn in your pc
* get in the project directory 
* run:
  - yarn install 
  - yarn start
